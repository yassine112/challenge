The views was created using code, I created a class that extends UITabBarController and I give it as root controller of my window in then appDelegate, I created a ViewController containe a MKMapView and i put the annotation with location that i recuperate from the webservice, I reexecute the function every 2 sec to get the new location et show it in the Map,
For the Passenger i call the web service but i got nil in the number and peaple fields, but in all cases i implmented the code to show the passengers in a table view
